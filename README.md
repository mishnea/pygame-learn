## Setting up the local repository

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8, Git, and a proper editor/IDE (I recommend VSCode)
2. Right click in the folder that you want the repo, and click 'git bash here'
3. Run the command `git clone https://github.com/mishnea/pygame-test`
4. Close Git and navigate to the top level of the repo
5. Hold shift + right click, and click on 'open powershell window here'
   - If the option isn't there, open powershell via Run > `pwsh` or however you want, and run the command
   `cd <path to the repo>`
6. Run the following in order
   - `python -m venv .venv`
   - `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`
   - `pip install -m requirements.txt`

You should now have all of the files, and a virtual environment with pygame.
